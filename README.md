# WinOwner MCP

**Your Windows. Your AI. Your Control.**

Owner-authorized remote coding and desktop automation for Windows through the Model Context Protocol (MCP).

> **Security-sensitive prerelease.** An AI client can perform actions using the permissions of the Windows account running the agent. This is not a sandbox or an independently certified security product. Do not expose an unauthenticated MCP endpoint publicly.

## What WinOwner MCP does

- **Remote coding:** inspect repositories, read and patch files, run commands and tests, review Git changes.
- **Owner verification:** OAuth 2.1 / PKCE S256, capability grants and revocable authorizations.
- **Recoverable changes:** SHA-256 file preconditions, backup/rollback tooling and audit records.
- **Windows control:** desktop interaction and task management when deliberately authorized.
- **Security controls:** a read-only default profile, owner console and emergency stop.

OAuth alone is not a differentiator. WinOwner's focus is the combination of *owner authorization, scoped execution and auditable, recoverable changes*.

## Client compatibility

| Client | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| ChatGPT | Verified on an owner's RC3 installation | Private tunnel and OAuth required |
| Claude, Cursor, Codex, other MCP clients | Not yet verified | Compatibility must be tested per client |

## Architecture

    AI["MCP client<br/>(ChatGPT verified)"] --> T["Operator-managed<br/>authenticated tunnel"]
    T --> A["Owner OAuth MCP adapter<br/>127.0.0.1:8768"]
    A --> P["Policy gateway / grants<br/>(embedded in adapter)"]

    P --> L[("Audit / revocation")]
    O["Host owner"] --> C["Local owner console<br/>127.0.0.1:8767 (optional)"]
```

Other local gateway, bridge and backend services may be used by the full legacy stack. Their availability and ports depend on deployment; the standalone adapter does not automatically provision those services.

## For beginners: double-click installer (no Git required)

1. On this GitHub page select **Code → Download ZIP**, then **Extract All** in Windows.
2. Open the extracted folder and double-click **Install-WinOwner.cmd**.
3. Wait for **LOCAL_INSTALL_PASS** and follow the automatically opened Vietnamese guide: [Start here — A to Z](docs/START_HERE.vi.md).

Requires Windows 10/11 and Python 3.12; the script attempts to install Python 3.12 via winget if available. The launcher installs a **local read-only** adapter and a current-user logon task; it does **not** create a tunnel, connect ChatGPT or grant owner-global access. Supported ChatGPT plugin access, a separate OpenAI Platform tunnel/runtime key and OAuth are required to finish remote pairing.

**Important:** historical RC3 ZIP assets do not include this new launcher. Use a release containing Install-WinOwner.cmd or the latest source ZIP.

## One-line Windows setup — local read-only MCP

Paste this **single line into PowerShell** (Git required; Python 3.12 can be installed with winget when available):

```powershell
git clone https://github.com/phuonghuster7/winowner-mcp.git winowner-mcp; if ($LASTEXITCODE -eq 0) { powershell.exe -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File ".\winowner-mcp\scripts\Bootstrap-WindowsMcp.ps1" }
```

The bootstrap configures read-only access, installs isolated Python dependencies and registers a **least-privilege Windows Task Scheduler job** that starts the local adapter automatically when the installing user logs in. It verifies health and rejects unauthenticated MCP calls. It does **not** enable OWNER_GLOBAL_FILESYSTEM, open firewall ports, configure a private tunnel or pair ChatGPT.

Use `powershell.exe -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\scripts\Bootstrap-WindowsMcp.ps1 -DryRun` to check prerequisites without changes; use `-Remove` to stop the owned service and unregister its logon task (credentials intentionally retained for manual removal). Bootstrap is idempotent and refuses to kill processes it cannot verify as its own.

**LOCAL_INSTALL_PASS is not OAuth pairing.** The one-line bootstrap is now available on `main`; it is **not present in the historical RC3 release ZIP**.

## Getting started on Windows 10/11

**Current published RC3:** Git and Python 3.12+ are required. Use a disposable Windows checkout:

```powershell
git clone https://github.com/phuonghuster7/winowner-mcp.git
cd winowner-mcp
py -3.12 -m venv .venv
.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
powershell.exe -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\scripts\Install-WindowsMcpAgent.ps1 -DryRun
```

The dry-run checks prerequisites; it **does not** enable remote access or connect a ChatGPT account. See [installation](docs/INSTALLATION.md) and [owner pairing](docs/CONNECT_CHATGPT.md).

**Bootstrap release track:** [PR #9](https://github.com/phuonghuster7/winowner-mcp/pull/9) was merged into `main`. The existing RC3 tag/ZIP remains historical; remote OAuth/tunnel pairing requires a separate owner-authorized step.

## Permission model

| Tier | Purpose | Default |
|---|---|---|
| READ | Search, inspect and read | Enabled in `read_only` |
| WRITE | Edit/create/delete files | Explicit authorization |
| EXECUTE | Run shell commands and tests | Explicit authorization |
| DESKTOP | Mouse, keyboard, windows | Explicit authorization |
| SYSTEM_ADMIN | Higher-impact administration | Denied by default |

`OWNER_GLOBAL_FILESYSTEM` is an **opt-in**, owner-only capability subject to the Windows service account's filesystem rights. It is not enabled in a standard installation. Text-pattern command blocking is an accident guard, **not a security boundary**.

## Testing and known limitations

- GitHub Actions covers source hygiene, history scanning, Ruff, selected security tests and installer dry-run.
- Some live authorization, physical desktop and rollback tests require a separately controlled Windows environment and are not yet covered by headless CI.
- A fresh external Windows machine, end-to-end remote pairing and an actual reboot/logon recovery test need separate release acceptance. Do not present RC3 as production-ready.
