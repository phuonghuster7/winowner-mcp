# Installation — WinOwner MCP (v1.0.0-rc3 candidate)

## Beginner / one-click local setup (no Git required)

Download the source ZIP using **Code → Download ZIP** on https://github.com/phuonghuster7/winowner-mcp, extract it, then double-click **Install-WinOwner.cmd**. The wrapper invokes the already audited local bootstrap with Windows PowerShell 5.1 and displays errors instead of silently exiting. Python 3.12 is installed through winget if available, otherwise install from python.org and rerun. The result is **LOCAL_INSTALL_PASS**, not ChatGPT pairing.

Follow [Vietnamese A–Z walkthrough](START_HERE.vi.md) for Platform permissions, private tunnel, OAuth and a real ChatGPT tool call. Prior RC3 release ZIPs do not contain the new launcher; use a newer source snapshot/release.

## Prerequisites

Use Windows 10/11 x64, PowerShell 5.1+ (or PowerShell 7), Python 3.12+, Git, and a dedicated user session. Review the security policy first. Do not expose the local MCP/console endpoints publicly.

## Clean checkout

Run in a fresh directory or disposable VM:

    git clone https://github.com/phuonghuster7/winowner-mcp.git winowner-mcp
    cd winowner-mcp
    py -3.12 -m venv .venv
    .\.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m pip install -r requirements-dev.txt

## One-line local setup

Prerequisite: Git on Windows. Paste into PowerShell:

```powershell
git clone https://github.com/phuonghuster7/winowner-mcp.git winowner-mcp; if ($LASTEXITCODE -eq 0) { powershell.exe -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File ".\winowner-mcp\scripts\Bootstrap-WindowsMcp.ps1" }
```

The bootstrap automatically creates the Python 3.12 virtual environment, installs dependencies, configures local read-only operation, creates a user-restricted local bearer [REDACTED], registers a least-privilege Task Scheduler job that runs the standalone adapter at owner logon, then tests /health and HTTP 401 without authentication. It fails closed when an unknown process uses the port or the task name is occupied; no firewall is opened. It can install Python 3.12 with winget where supported. Git itself cannot install or OAuth-pair an agent.

Run `powershell.exe -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\scripts\Bootstrap-WindowsMcp.ps1 -DryRun` for a non-mutating check. Run with `-Remove` to stop the verified local adapter and unregister the auto-start task. Existing secrets and policies remain on disk for owner-controlled cleanup. Auto-start has been verified across separate command sessions, but a full Windows reboot remains a separate acceptance check.

**LOCAL_INSTALL_PASS does NOT mean the ChatGPT connector is connected.** The operator must complete owner OAuth and private tunnel pairing using docs/CONNECT_CHATGPT.md. Owner full filesystem privileges are never provisioned automatically.

## Verify installer before modifying your workstation

    powershell.exe -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\scripts\Install-WindowsMcpAgent.ps1 -DryRun

Review the output and explicitly decide which local services, scheduled tasks and ports should be installed before running the non-dry-run script. Test installation in a clean VM first; this candidate has not yet passed a fresh-machine public install gate.

## Configure your own identity and scope

Start with example files under config/. Never copy the developer's actual policy.json, trusted_workspaces.json or tunnel-autonomous runtime files. Every machine and ChatGPT account needs its own OAuth owner onboarding, locally bound endpoints, tunnel setup and access scope. Keep read_only as the initial profile. Do not enable OWNER_GLOBAL_FILESYSTEM until identity, scope, audit, grants and revocation have been tested.

## Verify runtime

Check local service health, OAuth state and the watchdog without exposing secrets. For example, a configured adapter may listen on 127.0.0.1:8768; a healthy local port is not evidence that the cloud connector is authenticated. Validate the native agent_system_status and a harmless read-only file operation from the intended ChatGPT client.

## Tests and troubleshooting

Run collection and a focused non-mutating subset on a **disposable** checkout:

    .\.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m pytest --collect-only -q
    .\.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m pytest -q tests/test_mcp_gateway.py tests/test_owner_full_control.py tests/test_oauth_dynamic_owner.py tests/test_direct_coding_security.py

No shared OAuth secret or owner delegation is supplied in this repository. For a failed connector, check owner OAuth, tunnel runtime, port binding and logs locally; redact credentials before sharing any diagnostic output.
